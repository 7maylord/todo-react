This project was bootstrapped with [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/).



## Getting started

To get this app running locally, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your machine.
In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```


## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create Vite App documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
